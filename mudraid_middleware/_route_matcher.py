"""Compile and match the routes from ``mudraid_scopes.yaml``.

The middleware's hot path is ``(method, path) → RouteRule | None``.
Each row from the YAML carries a FastAPI-style pattern (e.g.
``/api/v1/items/{id}``) that we need to test against the concrete
path of the incoming request. Patterns get compiled to anchored
regexes once at startup; per-request lookup is then linear over a
small list of pre-compiled rules.

Locked behaviour (don't loosen without an explicit decision):

  - **Method match is exact and case-sensitive.** The YAML schema
    locks methods to the seven uppercase HTTP verbs (M5.2 enforces);
    incoming requests are uppercase by convention. We do not
    normalise either side — a mismatch is a real mismatch.
  - **Path segments do not cross ``/``.** ``{id}`` matches one
    URL segment, not many. ``/items/abc/def`` does NOT match
    ``/items/{id}``. (FastAPI's ``{path:path}`` catch-all is NOT
    supported in v1; the YAML schema doesn't lock its syntax.)
  - **Trailing slashes are significant.** ``/items`` and
    ``/items/`` are different routes. Starlette doesn't auto-
    normalise on the middleware hop either, so this matches what
    a handler downstream would see.
  - **First-match-wins by YAML order.** If two patterns could
    both match a path (e.g. ``/items/new`` listed before
    ``/items/{id}``), the first one in the YAML file wins. This
    lets a platform owner pin literal routes ahead of parametric
    ones by ordering their YAML, without needing a separate
    priority field.
  - **Case-sensitive on path.** URLs are case-sensitive per
    RFC 3986 §6.2.2.1 for the path component.

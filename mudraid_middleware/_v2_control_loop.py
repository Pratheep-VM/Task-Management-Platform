"""V2 enforcement control loop — the adapter-decision semantics, natively.

This module encodes the **portable adapter-decision contract**
(``mudraid.adapter.decision/1``) directly in the middleware, so a platform
running the Python server middleware in ``mode="v2"`` reaches the SAME
normalized outcome as the Kong ``mudraid-enforce`` Lua handler and the
reference runner in ``shared/mudraid_contracts`` — for the same facts.

Why a native copy (and not an import of ``mudraid_contracts``): the middleware
is a distributable SDK. Taking a hard runtime dependency on the internal
``mudraid_contracts`` package would leak the platform's private tooling into
every integrator's environment. So the control-loop **semantics** are mirrored
here, and the middleware's tests mirror the contract's fixture corpus to prove
agreement (see ``tests/unit/test_middleware_v2.py``).

The decision tree order mirrors ``handler.lua:access`` exactly:

  1. reserved ``x-mudraid-*`` request headers are stripped FIRST, before any
     evaluation, and even on requests that will be denied — trusted context is
     never accepted as an input fact;
  2. fail CLOSED when no verified signed bundle is active → ``not_safely_decided``;
  3. method classification — Streamable-HTTP control verbs pass, non-POST denies;
  4. bounded JSON-RPC framing — oversized / unreadable bodies deny, a JSON
     *array* (batch) is rejected wholesale, never partially evaluated;
  5. exact, case-sensitive canonical action resolution — never fuzzy/prefix;
  6. a live ``/decide`` call, required for every protected tool invocation and
     **deny-closed** on timeout / error / unconfigured;
  7. allow — and only then is trusted context injected downstream.

"not safely decided" (no bundle, ``/decide`` timeout/error) is deny-closed —
never optimistically treated as allow.

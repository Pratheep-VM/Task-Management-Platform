"""Parse and validate ``mudraid_scopes.yaml`` at middleware startup.

The schema is the ``MudraidScopesYaml`` component from
``docs/openapi.yaml`` in the MudraID backend repo — that file is the
single source of truth for the wire shape. Any divergence here would
allow a YAML the portal exports to be rejected (or, worse, silently
mis-interpreted) by the middleware, so the validation rules below
match the spec exactly.

Locked rules (don't loosen without an explicit decision):

  - Top level keys ``platform_id``, ``version``, ``routes`` are
    required.
  - ``platform_id`` is a non-empty string.
  - ``version`` is a positive integer (``True`` and ``False`` are
    rejected even though they are ``int`` in Python).
  - ``routes`` is a list; an empty list is permitted (a platform with
    no agent-facing routes is valid — every request would 404 to an
    agent, but that's the developer's choice).
  - Each route has ``method`` (one of the seven HTTP verbs) and
    ``path`` (non-empty, starting with ``/``).
  - Each route has EXACTLY ONE of ``scope`` (non-empty string),
    ``public: true``, or ``skip: true``. Combining them is a bug
    that we refuse to paper over — the developer needs to pick.

Failures raise :class:`MudraIDScopesYamlError`. We never silently
fall back to "allow everything" or "deny everything" on parse
failure — at startup, fail loud; mid-request, the YAML has
already been loaded and validated.

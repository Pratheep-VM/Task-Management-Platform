"""JWT validation against MudraID's JWKS.

Pulls the right public key out of the JWKS by ``kid``, then uses
PyJWT to verify the signature and the locked claim set:

  - ``iss``  — must equal ``expected_issuer`` (default
                ``"mudraid-identity"``), or, when ``expected_issuer`` is a
                sequence, be one of the configured transition set
  - ``aud``  — must equal the platform's ``platform_id`` (passed
                in by the middleware at construction)
  - ``exp``  — must be in the future (with leeway)
  - ``nbf``  — must not be in the future (with leeway)
  - ``iat``  — must be present (locked claim per backend M2.11)

On success the decoded claim dict is returned to the middleware,
which then checks ``scopes`` membership against the route's
required scope. The scope check intentionally lives in the
middleware, not here — this module is the JWT machinery, the
middleware is the policy.

PyJWT's exception types are mapped to a single
:class:`MudraIDInvalidTokenError` with a precise ``reason`` field
so the structured 401 response (M5.9) can surface a stable error
code without leaking the upstream message.
